      This blog is going to serve as a sort of journal of sorts for me to just
      empty out random thoughts or things that are currently bugging or
      inspiring me. Some posts might be super long, others might be a single
      sentence or quote. I'll be using this as a means to document my general
      consciousness.

          I look around at the world and I wonder if there is any way that
          humans can truly achieve peace. We are very tribalistic, by nature,
          and though we strive to be "good" and help others, it seems we get
          completely lost in the nebulous area of what is truly "good" and the
          collateral that's involved in nearly every decision we make. I'll
          focus on an extremely simple example to start. Let's say a loved one
          baked you a cake and asked you how you like it. Let's say you didn't
          like it: are you honest and tell the person you didn't like the cake
          or do you lie and tell them you enjoyed it because you don't want to
          hurt their feelings. Even such a simple situation has a surprising
          amount of butterfly effects. If you're honest, the person might be
          upset, they might even possibly think you're rude or a jerk because
          perhaps nobody else has criticized their baking before (possibly due
          to not being honest), but they also might appreciate the honesty so
          they can figure out what you didn't like specifically, or ponder on if
          they just did a poor job making it and need to improve the recipe. If
          you told a lie and said you liked the cake, it will likely make the
          other person feel good (because humans love feeling appreciated and
          like they did something impactful, no matter how small), but then this
          person will go on to make the same cake for others, who might also lie
          and say they like the cake when they don't, which doesn't end up
          making that person a better baker, which I'd argue is super important
          if, say, that person is a baker for their profession or hobby.
        </p>

          As you can see, even with something as simple as being gifted a cake
          can come with so many ethical dilemmas. Because of this, it seems
          absurd to think that we could manage things many magnitudes more
          complex when it comes to larger issues like healthcare, homelessness,
          and war.

          Clearly no single form of governance is without positives and
          negatives, and I think this is due to the innate infallibility of
          humans. As much as we can try and be objective, we are also
          handicapped by personal health issues, biases, and our own physical
          and mental needs and wants, and often, our inability to accept our own
          finite existence. It's more clear to see the innate problems in our
          society when you bring the scale down much further and imagine a small
          group of say 50 people that are trying to start a civilization, but
          you can also see, how we ended up where we are from the collective
          mindset. This is not me criticizing the collective concept, I'm just
          merely picking it apart for the sake of this post. Division and
          specialization of labor is vital to any society. This allows each
          individual in this town to focus on the thing they do well and provide
          that good for the rest of the town which they can use to barter with
          other towns members for their own goods which the farmer couldn't
          procure on their own. Now let's say we have a town member that is
          artistically gifted. The farmer has no interest or need for art, so
          there's no exchange of goods there, but the artist needs to eat still.
          One would argue that the artist should consider specializing in
          something more practically useful or tangible for the rest of the
          town, or at the very least, the farmer, so they can eat. Does the
          artist abandon what they are good at simply to put food on the table
          or does the artist find another means to get food, perhaps bartering
          with the person who owns the parlor in town that could use some
          decorations and artistry to liven up the place?

          I'm not going to lay out all the scenarios as this is kind of
          grade-school level stuff about understanding how specialization
          brought about globalization, but simplifying society down to being as
          basic as possible, you begin to see just how complex things can be. If
          things can get so complex on such a simple scale, to try and imagine
          it ever being even close to perfect on a large scale is just naive, in
          my opinion. That of course doesn't mean we shouldn't try to improve
          society, but my issue seems to be with how bloated and complicated our
          society has become, especially on a political level. I mean, even when
          you look at large companies, of which I've worked for many, you can
          see levels and levels of administrative bloat which always impedes
          progress. In order to add a simple button to an application my boss
          has to meet with the larger management team. Even when they all come
          to a decision, it has to be bounced off a designer of some kind to
          make sure that it fits within the company's branding. Perhaps that
          designer is contracted from outside the company, so for them to begin
          or continue work on the project, their management teams has to be
          informed of the requested work and then be delegated down to their
          designer. This process can take weeks or months in large companies.
          Now, even with a large company, there's usually a lot of internal
          specialization, and there's always lots of capital. Nearly anything
          can get done or be developed when the company has effectively
          bottomless pockets, the problem runs into the bureaucracy that can
          cause stagnancy, and even boredom, while employees can also just feel
          like a meaningless cog in a machine. The alternative would be a
          start-up, but then you get the other extreme of long excessive hours
          (most corporations force 40 hours, but can't force beyond that) where
          sometimes you can be working 60 to 80 hour weeks. The pay is usually
          better to compensate for the high mental or physical demands, and the
          company is usually able to change and pivot with the market due to
          less management bloat. I'm not saying either situation here is better,
          it just depends on the person.

          I don't want to spout too much exposition, but I guess the purpose of
          this post was just to point out how incredibly complex our societies
          are and how I think people need to always be aware that nearly
          anything comes with positives and negatives, but mostly pointing to
          how much harder it is for us to change things when there's so much
          "administration" in the middle. Perhaps balance is the best possible
          place you can be and what society should always be striving for. It
          seems harder and harder to achieve as time goes on, especially with
          the sensationalist and click-bait nature of the internet which is
          clearly monetarily incentivized to create division and pit neighbor
          against neighbor. I just implore people try to see the best in others
          and put aside your tribalism to really try and understand people
          rather than just labeling them as gross or even evil. More people just
          need to learn to agree to disagree and not hate the person because of
          it.

          I know this post kind of went on a few different tangents, just had a
          few different things on my mind and needed to just vent them out right
          now, mainly, that humans are incapable of creating a utopia, no matter
          how hard we try. That's not to be negative, it's just a fact. Doesn't
          mean we stop trying, of course, but it will not get better as long as
          people don't acknowledge they could be wrong, and that nearly
          everything is infinitely complex, thus, we can't expect a simple
          solution to please everyone. Of course, we try our best to please the
          majority, so I guess that continues to be our goal, but as time has
          shown, sometimes those minorities turn into majorities and revolution
          happens or becomes necessary. Not drawing any points or making any
          kind of political statements here, just worth point out.

          I'll get better with my structure and conciseness the more posts I
          make. Thanks if you read through my silly inner workings.
