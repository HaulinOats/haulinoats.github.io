    <h1>Stardew Valley - Realistic Farming Utility</h1>
    <p>Are you tired of the farming aspect of Stardew Valley being too predictable, knowing you can just resort to posts and articles online that tell you the objectively best crops to maximize profit? This utility will pseudo-randomize all the properties of both seeds and crops to help keep farming balanced but also, randomize crops and seeds values so you'll have to figure out the most efficient crops on your own.</p>
    <p>
      This utility it built to work with the Stardew Valley mod
