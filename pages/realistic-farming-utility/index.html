    <h1>Stardew Valley - Realistic Farming Utility</h1>
    <p>
      Are you tired of the farming aspect of Stardew Valley being too
      predictable, knowing you can just resort to posts and articles online that
      tell you the objectively best crops to maximize profit? This utility will
      pseudo-randomize all the properties of both seeds and crops to help keep
      farming balanced but also, randomize crops and seeds values so you'll have
      to figure out the most efficient crops on your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      This utility it built to work with the Stardew Valley mod

    <h2>How to use</h2>
    <p>
      Upload your the <code>content.json</code> file that exists inside the
      <code>[CP] Balanced Valley - Realistic Farming</code> mod folder and then
      click <b>Generate</b>. The file will be updated with new psuedo-randomized
      crop values (harvest time, sell prices, regrowth capability, etc) so
      you'll have to figure out the most efficient crops on your own. Then
      simply place this file back into the
      <code>[CP] Balanced Valley - Realistic Farming</code> mod folder,
      overwriting the existing <code>content.json</code> file.
