<h1>Digital Privacy Notice</h1>

<p>This application parses local xml files (healthcare_provider.xml and health_plan.xml) to allow for user customization</p>

<h2>Important Notes:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>users must explicitly keep the same names for the XML files or must change the file names within the custom javascript file at the "loadXML" function</li>
  <li>The user must set up their own database to capture user data.  Edit the 'dpnc_dp_connect.php' file inside 'inc' folder</li>
</ul>
